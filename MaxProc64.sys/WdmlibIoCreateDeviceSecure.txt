This function is responsible for creating a device object for the driver and setting up some callback
routines by making a call to WdmlibInit(). Lets explain a bit what this function does.

WdmlibInit() resolves the base addresses of kernel functions IoCreateDeviceSecure and 
IoValidateDeviceIoControlAccess. It then creates an object for the driver with device name
"\\Device\\MaxProc64". All this is done in a callback routines which if finally called when the device is
set up and ready to run.

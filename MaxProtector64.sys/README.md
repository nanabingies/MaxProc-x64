# DriverEntry
The function sets up a named device object by calling WdmlibIoCreateDeviceSecure which device name MaxProtector64. It proceeds to create a symbolic name for the device before making 2 successive calls to ExAllocatePoolWithTag to allcoate memory in NonPagedPool.

The driver finishes off by setting it's IRP dispatch handlers. IRP_MJ_CREATE and IRP_MJ_CLOSE are both set to sub_11214 and IRP_MJ_DEVICE_CONTROL is set to sub_1123C. The driver then sets its Unload routine to sub_1111C and makes a call to sub_12364. This function reads a value from the registry and stores it in an allocated heap before comparing it to check if it's the value 'one'. It makes another call to sub_12364 this time querying the string 'ProtectSystemRegistry'. 

The driver registers itself as a minifilter driver by calling FltRegisterFilter and starts the filtering process  by calling FltStartFiltering. The driver then registers its callback routine sub_1F068 then sets some global values to 0 before exiting.
